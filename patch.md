# Patch Notes - Ediens Food Sharing Platform

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: DO NOT PULL REQUEST node_modules FOLDER**

## 2024-01-15 - Registration Bug Fix and Security Improvements

### Issues Identified:
1. **Registration Failed** - Users couldn't register due to database field mismatch
2. **Backend Won't Start** - Server hanging due to database connection issues
3. **Missing Security Features** - No rate limiting or input sanitization
4. **Git Issues** - node_modules folder being tracked (causing massive pull requests)

### Root Causes:
1. **Database Field Mismatch**: Registration route was trying to create users with `location` field, but User model expects `latitude` and `longitude`
2. **Database Not Running**: Docker services not started, causing backend to hang
3. **Missing .gitignore**: node_modules folder being tracked by Git

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Database Model Fix (User Registration) ✅ COMPLETED
- Fixed field mismatch in `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
- Changed from `location: { type: 'Point', coordinates: [0, 0] }` to `latitude: 0, longitude: 0`
- This matches the User model schema exactly

#### 2. Environment Variables Fix ✅ COMPLETED
- Fixed path issues in `backend/src/server.js` and `backend/src/database/connection.js`
- Backend can now properly read `.env` file from root directory
- Database connection settings are now loaded correctly

#### 3. Security Middleware Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
- Created `backend/src/middleware/security.js` with comprehensive protection
- Added rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- Added account lockout after failed attempts
- Added input sanitization to prevent XSS
- Enhanced CSRF protection with origin checking

#### 4. Git Configuration Fix ✅ COMPLETED
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude:
  - `node_modules/` (dependencies)
  - `.env` (environment variables)
  - `dist/` (build outputs)
  - Logs and temporary files
- This prevents massive pull requests with auto-generated files

### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` - Fixed registration field mismatch
- `backend/src/server.js` - Fixed environment variable loading
- `backend/src/database/connection.js` - Fixed environment variable loading
- `backend/src/middleware/security.js` - NEW: Added security features
- `.gitignore` - NEW: Excludes unnecessary files from Git

### Current Status:
- ✅ **Registration Bug**: Fixed in code
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Fixed
- ✅ **Security Features**: Enhanced
- ✅ **Git Configuration**: Fixed
- ❌ **Backend Still Won't Start**: Database services not running

### Next Steps:
1. **Start Database Services**: Docker needs to be running for PostgreSQL
2. **Test Registration**: Verify the fix works once backend is running
3. **Security Testing**: Test rate limiting and protection features

### Notes:
- The registration issue was a simple field mismatch that's now resolved
- Security has been significantly improved with rate limiting and input sanitization
- Git will no longer track node_modules, preventing massive pull requests
- Backend startup issue is related to missing database services, not code problems

### Summary of Changes:
- **Fixed**: User registration field mismatch that was preventing new user creation
- **Fixed**: Environment variable loading issues
- **Enhanced**: Security with rate limiting, input sanitization, and CSRF protection
- **Fixed**: Git tracking of unnecessary files
- **Identified**: Database service dependency issue (Docker not running)
